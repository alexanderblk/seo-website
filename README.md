# SEO Website

## Description
This projects is a website that focuses on offering products to improve your website. Horiseon is a company that offers Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing, products that will help improve your website and increase the traffic on it.

My task for this website was to refactor the code in order to meet the accessibility standards. In order to do that, I have replaced some of the elements in the HTML code with semantic tags that are important for visitors using screen readers and other types of users.

# Challenges

The main challenge was to identify what was wrong in the starter code and how to come up with complex solution to the problem.

As an easy solution, I thought that it would be easier to add semantic tags around the current code, but I realised after that the style and layout of the website was ruined.

My final code looks like this : ![Final Code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115581300/197336013-32db822b-f1b2-4226-b712-7b6a6bee1148.png)

I have learned that comments have a very important role when writing code.
